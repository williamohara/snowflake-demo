#VGS Vault App for Snowflake demonstration data

This repo contains queries that one can cut and paste into a Snowflake Workbook or, if you are using VSCode as your editor, use the Snowflake VS Code extention to execute these queries directly in VS Code. (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snowflake.snowflake-vsc) 

These queries produce the data that you will need to follow along with our quickstart video. The data is not real and was randomly generated. Any data that may be close to a real individual's personal data is purely coincidental.
